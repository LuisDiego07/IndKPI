# IndKPIs  
**Performance Indicators for Industrial Production**

IndKPIs is an industrial telemetry and analytics platform designed to collect, process, and analyze machine data, generating **KPIs and performance indicators** for manufacturing environments.

This project simulates real-world industrial telemetry, processes operational data, and exposes metrics through analytical pipelines and dashboards.

## 🚗 Release 1 — Automotive Industry

The first release focuses on the **automotive manufacturing sector**, simulating production lines with automated machines such as CNCs, welding robots, and presses.

The goal is to model **realistic shop-floor behavior**, including:
- Production cycles
- Downtime and failures
- Quality losses
- Energy consumption
- Machine performance degradation
