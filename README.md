# IndKPIs  
**Performance Indicators for Industrial Production**

IndKPIs is an industrial telemetry and analytics platform designed to collect, process, and analyze machine data, generating **KPIs and performance indicators** for manufacturing environments.

This project simulates real-world industrial telemetry, processes operational data, and exposes metrics through analytical pipelines and dashboards.

---

## 🚗 Release 1 — Automotive Industry

The first release focuses on the automotive manufacturing sector, simulating production lines with automated machines such as CNCs, welding robots, and presses.

The goal is to model realistic shop-floor behavior, including:

Production cycles

Downtime and failures

Quality losses

Energy consumption

Machine performance degradation

## 🏗️ Data Architecture — Medallion Pattern

This project follows the Medallion Architecture, a common industry standard for analytical data platforms.

🟤 Bronze Layer — Raw Data

Ingests raw telemetry events generated by the simulator

Minimal validation and type coercion

Stored as Parquet files

Represents the immutable source of truth

⚪ Silver Layer — Enriched Data

Normalizes and enriches telemetry data

Adds operational flags (runtime, downtime, failures)

Calculates intermediate metrics (good units, operating time)

Stored as Parquet files, ready for analytical aggregation

🟡 Gold Layer — Analytics & KPIs

The Gold layer exposes finalized KPIs (e.g. OEE) and is designed with two complementary output paths:

1️⃣ Gold as Parquet (Open & Reproducible)

Gold datasets are persisted as Parquet files

Fully reproducible by anyone cloning the repository

Enables local validation, exploration, and further analysis

Guarantees transparency of calculations and metrics

This path ensures that all users can access and reproduce the analytical results, even without external infrastructure.

2️⃣ Gold as Star Schema (Analytical Database)

Gold datasets are also modeled as a Star Schema:

Fact tables (e.g. OEE metrics)

Dimension tables (machines, dates, etc.)

Designed to be stored in a PostgreSQL analytical database

Optimized for BI tools and dashboard consumption

⚠️ Direct access to the PostgreSQL database is not publicly available.

Instead, this repository provides:

The SQL DDL used to create fact and dimension tables

Example SQL queries used by dashboards

A public dashboard URL, allowing anyone to visualize the results without database access

This approach reflects real-world enterprise environments, where database access is restricted but insights are shared.

---

## 📊 Dashboards & Analytics

Dashboards are built on top of the Gold analytical model, using a BI tool connected to the Star Schema database.

A public dashboard URL is provided so that reviewers and users can explore:

OEE by machine

Availability, Performance and Quality breakdowns

Production and downtime metrics

The dashboard reflects data generated by the simulator and processed through the full Medallion pipeline.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

Demonstrate an industrial-grade data architecture

Apply real manufacturing KPIs (OEE, availability, quality)

Showcase best practices in data engineering

Provide a reproducible, auditable and realistic analytics pipeline
