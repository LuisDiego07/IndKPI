# IndKPIs  
**Performance Indicators for Industrial Production**

IndKPIs is an industrial telemetry and analytics platform designed to collect, process, and analyze machine data, generating **KPIs and performance indicators** for manufacturing environments.

This project simulates real-world industrial telemetry, processes operational data through a Medallion data architecture, and exposes metrics via analytical models and dashboards.

# 🚗 Release 1 — Automotive Industry

The first release focuses on the automotive manufacturing sector, simulating production lines with automated machines such as:

- CNC machines  
- Welding robots  
- Hydraulic presses  

The simulation models realistic shop-floor behavior, including:

- Production cycles  
- Downtime and failures  
- Quality losses  
- Energy consumption  
- Machine performance degradation  

The goal is to represent real industrial dynamics and calculate manufacturing KPIs such as **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**.

# 🏗️ Data Architecture — Medallion Pattern

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, a widely adopted industry standard for analytical data platforms.

## 🟤 Bronze Layer — Raw Data

- Ingests raw telemetry events generated by the simulator  
- Minimal validation and type coercion  
- Stored as **Parquet files**  
- Represents the immutable source of truth  

**Flow:** JSON → Bronze Parquet  

---

## ⚪ Silver Layer — Enriched Data

- Normalizes and cleans telemetry data  
- Adds operational flags (runtime, downtime, failures)  
- Calculates intermediate metrics (good units, operating time, stop categories)  
- Structured for analytical aggregation  

Stored as **Parquet files**, optimized for transformations and KPI computation.

**Flow:** Bronze → Silver

## 🟡 Gold Layer — Analytics & KPIs

The Gold layer exposes finalized KPIs and supports two complementary output paths:

---

### 1️⃣ Gold as Parquet (Open & Reproducible)

- Gold datasets persisted as **Parquet files**
- Fully reproducible by anyone cloning the repository
- Enables local validation and exploration
- Guarantees transparency of calculations and metrics

This path ensures that analytical results can be reproduced without requiring external infrastructure.

**Execution:**
```bash
python run_gold_oee_parquet.py
